# UPDATE

The person I was building this site for had abandoned the project so I am leaving it in the
current state, after making some fixes so that it is viewable without any glaring problems.

## Tech

This project uses Typescript, NodeJS, Express, Webpack, Jest, and PostgreSQL for the database.

Uses SendGrid for transactional emails for the contact API.

## Frontend

The project is split into front-end and back-end repositories. The front-end, [whitelist-backend](https://github.com/lgoodcode/whitelist)
contains all the code that renders the page.

## About this site

This is my first real website project I'm currently working on. I'm working on my Typescript,
React, Redux state management, and design skills. I am also trying to get used to proper
version control with Git. I'm trying to keep the history as clean as possible using a
seperate branch to perform work on and the squash merging it into main with a revised
commit message of all the squashed commits.
